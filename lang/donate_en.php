                      We work passionately as part of and for a thriving open source community.<br />
                      As we are not a commercial organization, we do not do paid work and contribute to the project during our free time.<br />
                      You can support us financially by donating: your contribution could be as little as buying us a glass of beer to as much
                       as being enough to make you qualify as a sponsor.<br />
                      So if you like OpenMandriva and appreciate our work, go ahead and show your love by donating through the button below.
