          <h2>Preamble</h2>
          <p>By using this service you agree to be bound by the following terms.<br>
          OpenMandriva reserves the right to update and change these terms from time to time.</p>
          <h2>Short version (TL; DR as we say)</h2>
          <p>For ease of reading, without the legal talk, we propose you below an understandable version of a normal human being.</p>
          <p>We're nice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your content belongs to you (but we encourage you to publish under free license);</li>
            <li>OpenMandriva will not exploit your personal information except to achieve internal statistics (anonymous) or to alert you of an important change to the service;</li>
            <li>OpenMandriva not provide or resell your personal data (your privacy is important to us - really);</li>
            <li>Commitments OpenMandriva result of militant approach inspired by the movement of popular education, you can find them in our Service Charter Free, Ethical, and Decentralized Solidarity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But we're not Care Bears:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clause "The law is the law, and we don't wanna end up in jail": you must obey the law (as good or silly it may be), otherwise your account will be deleted;</li>
            <li>Clause "Thank you for being polite and respectful with its neighbors service": you must respect other users by demonstrating good citizenship and civility, if your content or your account may be deleted without negotiations;</li>
            <li>Clause "If it breaks, it is not obliged to repair" OpenMandriva offers this service for free and freely. If you lose data, your fault or ours, sorry, but it happens. We will do what we can to get them back, but we do assign any obligation of result. Clearly, avoid putting sensitive or important data on OpenMandriva services, because in case of loss, we do not guarantee its recovery;</li>
            <li>Clause "If you're not happy, you are invited to go elsewhere" if the service does not suit you, you are free to find an equivalent (or better) elsewhere, or mount yours;</li>
            <li>Clause "Any violation will be punished" if a user abuses the service, eg by monopolizing shared machine resources, or publishing content considered irrelevant, its content or account may be deleted without warning or negotiation. OpenMandriva remains the sole judge of this notion of "abuse" in order to provide the best possible service to all of its users. If this sounds anti-democratic, anti-libriste, anti-freedom-of expression, thank you refer to the preceding clause;</li>
            <li>Clause "Nothing is eternal": the services can shut (for lack of funds to maintain, for example), they can be victims of intrusion (the "100% secure" does not exist). We encourage you to keep a copy of the data that matter to you because OpenMandriva can not be held responsible for their accommodation without time limits.</li>
